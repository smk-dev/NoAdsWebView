NoAdsWebView is proof of concept project. It allows you to build an iOS web browser based on UIKit's UIWebView with many advantages:
- faster, because less content is being downloaded,
- safer, you can filter JavaScript files attached to web page,
- cheaper, with less content downloaded you use less mobile traffic.

Feel free to take a look in settings tab and turn off few options. Then go to Browser tab and type in URL.
